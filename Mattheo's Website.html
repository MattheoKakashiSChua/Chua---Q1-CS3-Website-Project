            <h1>Introduction:</h1> 
            <p>Our mission is to get rid of what is known as Gender Inequality.
                Gender Inequality is a current social issue everybody knows at the moment. It refers to two genders getting unequal treatment and it would be otherwise known as Sexism (which contributed to the making of the issue Gender Inequality).
                Many people are complaining and giving negative feedback saying that they should stop this unequal treatment madness that had driven people crazy. To stop this, here are 5 things to stop Gender Inequality and make life easier.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Education.</h2> 
            <p>With education, they are able to learn on how to equally treat boys/men and girls/women especially when the topics are mostly focused on gender equality. This is a compact and simple way to master gender equality because they MUST understand the importance of gender equality in our lives.</p>
        
            <h2>2. Making Gender Equality a policy or a law in any area.</h2> 
            <p>Gender Equality and its properties MUST be included in the rules of basically everywhere so that the people around the area will follow as it is conducted in the rules. This way, there would not be much fuss about unequal treatment and it can help us make use of its impact in our daily lives. In other words, Gender Equality is often depicted as a REQUIREMENT in the rules to avoid violence.</p>
        
            <h2>3. Speak it out.</h2> 
            <p>If you, User, had enough of this unequal treatment nonsense, you can speak out loud on what you think about this gender inequality issue and how it affects other people. This way, more people would pick your side because they had also felt the same thing and could revolt against the issue. Later on, people will make agreements that they should stop Gender Inequality depending on some following conditions. Once agreed, they may or may not thank you for encouraging other people to stop treating other people differently just because they are different genders.</p>
       
            <h2>4. Economic Empowerment</h2>
            <p>Just ensure that the laws say if both genders did equal work, the wage would be equal for both men and women as it shows gender equality. To really stop this issue, we must include some equal works when doing our jobs because Gender Inequality can basically occur anywhere in the vicinity.</p>
        
            <h2>5. Encouragement of STEM Education for Women.</h2>
            <p>Originally, STEM Education is a male-dominated career but we also have to educate women this specific career so that women could also expand their ideas and critical thinking which is essential for their courses and is to avoid Gender Inequality.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>To summarize everything based on the list above, Gender Inequality is a generally concerning social issue in the physical world as it has complains about it and even negative feedback. Because of the factors that were listed, Gender Inequality would most likely be reduced by the time EVERYONE MASTERS Gender Equality which was our purpose on making this website.</p>
